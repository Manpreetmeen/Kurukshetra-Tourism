        <h2>About Kurukshetra</h2>
        <p>
          Kurukshetra (Hindi pronunciation: [kʊrʊkʃeːtɾə], pronunciationⓘ) is a
          city and administrative headquarters of Kurukshetra district in the
          Indian state of Haryana. It is also known as Dharmakshetra ("Realm of
          duty") and as the "Land of the Bhagavad Gita".

          Kuru Kingdom, founded by King Puru—the ancestors of Kauravas and
          Pandavas Vedic Indo-Aryan tribal union in northern Iron Age[5][6] (c.
          1200 – c. 900 BCE), developed into the first recorded state-level
          society (janapada) in the Indian subcontinent.[7][8][9] This kingdom
          documented their ritual hymns into collections called the Vedas, and
          developed new rituals which gained their position in Indian
          civilization as the Srauta rituals,[7] which contributed to the
          "classical synthesis"[9] or "Hindu synthesis" (roots of Hinduism).[10]
          It was the dominant political and cultural center of the middle Vedic
          Period during the reigns of Parikshit and Janamejaya,[7] but declined
          in importance during the late Vedic period (c. 900 – c. 500 BCE) and
          had become "something of a backwater"[9] by the Mahajanapada period in
          the 5th century BCE. Traditions and legends about the Kurus continued
          into the post-Vedic period, providing the basis for the Mahabharata
          epic.[7] The time-frame and geographical extent of the Kuru kingdom
          (as determined by philological study of the Vedic literature)
          corresponds with the archaeological Painted Grey Ware culture.[9]
          Kurukshetra was conquered by the Mauryan empire in the late 4th
          century BCE and subsequently became a center of Buddhism and Hinduism.
          The history of Kurukshetra is little-known in between the collapse of
          the Mauryans and the rise of the Kushans who conquered the region.
          After the decline of Kushan power in the region, Kurukshetra became
          independent only to become conquered by the Gupta empire in the early
          4th century CE. Under Gupta rule, Kurukshetra experienced a cultural
          and religious revival and became a center for Hinduism. After the fall
          of the Gupta, the Pushyabhuti dynasty ruled over Kurukshetra.[11]

          Kurukshetra is an important Hindu pilgrimage destination, and there
          are several pilgrimage sites surrounding the city. The Hindi phrase 48
          kos parikrama refers to a roughly 90-km traditional circle (Parikrama)
          around the holy city (1 kos equals about 3.00 km or 1.91 miles), and a
          complete parikrama refers to a pilgrimage to all these sites on
          foot.[15][16] The International Gita Mahotsav, held every year in
          Kururukshetra on the Shukla Ekadashi—the 11th day of the waxing moon
          of the Margashirsha (Agrahayan) month of the Hindu calendar,
          celebrates the day Bhagavad Gita was revealed to Arjuna by Krishna in
          the battlefield of Kurukshetra.[17]
